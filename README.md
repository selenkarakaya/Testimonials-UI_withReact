# 🗣️ Testimonials UI

## 📜 Description
**Testimonials UI** is a user interface built with React that allows users to submit, view, and manage feedback entries. Users can add their name and feedback, with a submit button that only activates when the feedback meets a minimum character length requirement. This project served as a foundational UI component, which has since been integrated into other projects to enhance user feedback functionality.
